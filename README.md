# Neovim Configuration Files

This repository contains all the required files
for my personal Neovim configuration. 

## Why not VSCode?

I use Neovim for the productivity speed and efficient text editing. 
I enjoy the "do it yourself" approach with my tooling, which is one of the
main reasons why I use Linux.
